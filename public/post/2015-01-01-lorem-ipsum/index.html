      <p>The development of financial technology has led to an increase in the closure of bank branches in many countries. 
        In the UK, the total number of bank and building society branches fell by 34% 
        between 2012 and 2021 (See Booth 2022, Browning 2022, Edmonds 2018) and Small Business Finance Markets Report 2023 
        by the <a href="british-business-bank.co.uk"> British Business Bank BBB 2023 </a>. </p>
        
      <p> Gopal & Schnabl (2022) investigate the credit supply to small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 
        financial crisis in the US. The data cover 3,717 banks and 3,841 nonbanks, 
        mostly finance companies and FinTech lenders, which tended to lend to smaller firms. 
        They show that nonbank lenders almost perfectly offset the decline in bank lending during the financial crisis. 
        Gopal & Schnabl (2022)'s results suggest that P2P and banking lending to SMEs might be complements,
        rather than substitutes. Tang (2019), however, found that P2P to consumers tend to be complement to bank credit.</p>
         
  <p> Banking credit to SMEs also declined in the UK in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, but took seven years 
  to recover to pre-2008 levels, and data from the Bank of England clearly show that peer-to-peer (P2P) lending started growing
  exactly in the same year <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2020/open-data-for-sme-finance"> bank lending reached
    the 2008 level </a>. This suggests that P2P and bank lending to SMEs might be complements, 
  rather than substitutes as found by Gopal & Schnabl (2022). 
  To the extent of our knowledge there is no such empirical research in the UK. </p>
